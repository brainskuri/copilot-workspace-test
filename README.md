# Rust HTTP Client Tool

This tool is a simple HTTP client written in Rust that allows you to fetch the content of a web page and print it to the terminal, similar to the functionality of `curl`.

## Usage

To use the tool, run the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- <URL>
```

Replace `<URL>` with the URL of the web page you want to fetch.

## Example

```sh
cargo run -- https://www.example.com
```

This will fetch the content of `https://www.example.com` and print it to the terminal.
